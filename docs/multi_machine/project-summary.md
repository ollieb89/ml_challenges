## 🚀 Quick Start Path (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Prerequisites (1 hour)

```bash
# Step 1: Verify all 3 machines can see each other on network
ping 192.168.1.101  # From main desktop
ping 192.168.1.102  # From main desktop

# Step 2: Install NVIDIA drivers (if not already done)
nvidia-smi  # Check on each machine
```

### Phase 2: Setup (30 minutes)

**On each machine:**

```bash
# 1. Set static IP
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
sudo netplan apply

# 2. Create conda environment
conda create -n dist-train python=3.11 -y
conda activate dist-train

# 3. Install PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# 4. Install ML stack
pip install transformers datasets accelerate peft unsloth[colab-new] tensorboard

# 5. Verify
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

**On main desktop only:**

```bash
# 1. Setup SSH passwordless auth
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@192.168.1.101
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@192.168.1.102

# 2. Create project structure
mkdir -p ~/ai-cluster/{scripts,data,checkpoints,logs}

# (Use code from train-production-script.md)
```

### Phase 3: Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# On each machine, test single GPU
cd ~/ai-cluster/scripts
python -c "
import torch
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
model, tok = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained('unsloth/tinyllama-bnb-4bit', max_seq_length=2048, dtype=torch.float16, load_in_4bit=True)
print('✓ Ready for training')
"

## 🎯 What This Setup Does

### Capabilities

✅ **Distributed LLM Training**
- Fine-tune Llama, Mistral, Code Llama, etc. across 3 GPUs
- Use PyTorch DDP (Distributed Data Parallel)
- Automatic gradient synchronization

✅ **Memory Optimization**
- 4-bit quantization (fits 7B on all GPUs)
- LoRA adapters (add ~500MB trainable parameters)
- Gradient checkpointing (reduce activation memory)

✅ **Production Ready**
- Checkpoint saving (resume training)
- TensorBoard monitoring
- Rank-based logging
- Automatic failure recovery

✅ **Easy to Scale**
- Add 4th machine? Just add `--node_rank=3`
- Different GPU sizes? DDP handles it (though bottlenecked by slowest)
- Bigger models? Upgrade to FSDP when needed

### Not Included (But Can Add)

- Model serving/inference API (use vLLM or TGI after training)
- Automated data preprocessing
- Hyperparameter search
- Advanced parallelism (FSDP, tensor parallelism)

## 🔧 Key Configuration Defaults

Used in `train_production.py`:

```python
# Model
model_name = "unsloth/tinyllama-bnb-4bit"  # Change to your model
max_seq_length = 2048                       # Reduce to 1024 if OOM

# Training
num_epochs = 3
learning_rate = 2e-4
batch_size_per_gpu = 1                      # REQUIRED for Unsloth DDP
gradient_accumulation_steps = 8             # Effective batch = 24

# LoRA
lora_r = 16
lora_alpha = 32
target_modules = ["q_proj", "v_proj"]

# Optimization
load_in_4bit = True                         # 4-bit quantization
use_gradient_checkpointing = True           # Memory optimization
```

**To change:**
- Model: `--model-name meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`
- Epochs: `--num-epochs 5`
- Learning rate: `--learning-rate 1e-4`

## 🐛 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "connect() call failed" | Check firewall allows port 29500: `telnet 192.168.1.100 29500` |
| "CUDA out of memory" | Reduce batch size or sequence length |
| One GPU much slower | Normal with heterogeneous GPUs, DDP handles it |
| Training hangs after init | Check all nodes started within 30 seconds of each other |
| Different PyTorch versions | All must match: `pip install torch==2.1.0` on all machines |
| Can't SSH to workers | Setup passwordless: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@192.168.1.101` |

See **architecture-guide.md** for full troubleshooting matrix.

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

While training:

```bash
# Terminal 4: Monitor GPUs
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Terminal 5: View TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir ~/ai-cluster/logs/runs/
# Access at http://localhost:6006

# Terminal 6: Check logs
tail -f ~/ai-cluster/logs/training_rank0_*.log
```

Expected during training:
- GPU memory increases to ~8-10 GB
- GPU utilization 70-90%
- All 3 GPUs show Python processes
- Loss decreasing each epoch

## 🔐 Security Notes

Your setup runs on local LAN only. For production:

- SSH uses password-less authentication (acceptable for local/trusted network)
- Port 29500 open on firewall (local only, safe)
- No data encryption (local network, safe)
- No authentication for training jobs (local only, safe)

For external usage, add:
- VPN or SSH tunnel
- Authentication tokens
- Data encryption

## 📞 Debugging Resources

In order of usefulness:

1. **Logs** - Check `~/ai-cluster/logs/training_rank{0,1,2}_*.log`
2. **GPU Status** - `nvidia-smi` and `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.free --format=csv`
3. **Network** - `ping`, `ssh -v`, `telnet`
4. **PyTorch** - Set `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` before training
5. **This guide** - Reference troubleshooting matrix

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with TinyLlama first** - Fast iteration, catches bugs early
2. **Monitor GPU memory** - `nvidia-smi -l 1` shows live updates
3. **Save checkpoints frequently** - Resume from failures instantly
4. **Use gradient accumulation** - Simulate larger batches without OOM
5. **Enable gradient checkpointing** - Already done in training script
6. **Benchmark before training** - Run `train_single_test.py` first
7. **Keep logs** - Always check rank 0 logs first for issues
8. **Test connectivity** - `ping 192.168.1.101` before launching
9. **Use absolute paths** - Avoids "file not found" issues
10. **Sync time across nodes** - `sudo timedatectl set-ntp true`
